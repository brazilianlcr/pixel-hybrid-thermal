This repository was built as part of the ATLAS Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Objective: Perform Finite Element Analysis on ATLAS's microelectronics and assess thermomechanical properties. Prevent failure and excessive heating. 

All files are suitable input for FreeCAD FEM package. CAD files contain chip models and material files contain relevant material properties.  

PPCode is a data post-processing algorithm written in Python in order to smooth the high variance near material interfaces.
